## Student Projects

Documentary originally created as the Term Project in MIT "D-Lab Water and Climate Change" class. "Local Water" investigates the challenges to the oyster industry in Wellfleet, Massachusetts. Those major challenges include ocean acidification, caused by climate change, and coastal pollution, caused by development stresses.
